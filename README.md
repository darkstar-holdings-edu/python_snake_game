# Snake Game

This is repo contains code that I generate while working on the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) udemy course for learning Python.

This repo covers the project for days 20 and 21 of the course.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) [^1]
- tkinter

[^1]: Note: I use `pipenv` becaue I like the combination of the `venv` and `pip` commands together. However, I know it's not for everyone. So I've created a `requirements.txt` file if you don't like `pipenv` and just want to use `pip` instead.

### Installation

```sh
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
```

## Usage

- `main.py`: Executable to launch the game.
